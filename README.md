# RayTracer

An implementation of a ray tracer using [the Ray Tracer Challenge book](http://raytracerchallenge.com/), using Elixir. The Ray Tracer Challenge is pretty fun because it doesn't give you any code - it gives you tests (as pseudocode) to implement, and leaves it up to you to make those tests pass with your code. It's a great way to practice TDD and get creative with your program design. Been learning a lot about Elixir and ray tracing.
